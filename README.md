## Usage

### Commands

#### Organize Files
Organize files in a specified folder by analyzing their content and sorting them into categorized subfolders.

```bash
python fastfox.py organize <folder_path>
```

Example:
```bash
python fastfox.py organize C:\Users\Icarus\Pictures
```

#### Command Suggestions
Get AI-generated command-line suggestions.

```bash
python fastfox.py command "<query>"
```

Example:
```bash
python fastfox.py command "List all files in a directory"
```

#### Code Generation and Suggestions
Generate or suggest code for a given file.

```bash
python fastfox.py codeit <file_path>
```

Example:
```bash
python fastfox.py codeit C:\Users\Icarus\Projects\main.py
```

You will be prompted to choose between code generation or suggestion.
- Generation: Generates code based on the provided file.
- Suggestion: Suggests changes to the provided file.

#### Forget History
Forget previous command history or clear all stored information.

```bash
python fastfox.py forget <all|command|codeit|organize>
```

Example:
```bash
python fastfox.py forget all
```

### Performance
FastFox is designed to work faster than traditional file explorers, organizing files in the blink of an eye with asynchronous processing. Command suggestions and code generation also leverage cutting-edge AI to minimize latency.
